Each player gets THREE pieces.
1.
Each turn, players can put one piece on the board in any open spot.
2.
After all three pieces are on the board, 
a player must move one piece each turn.
3.
A piece may move along any line or curving edge 
of the circle to the next empty spot.
4.
A piece may not jump other pieces nor move more than one spot.
5.
The first person to get 3 in a row wins.

Note:
You can get 3 in a row by either having 3 around the circle in a row or 
by having a straight line of your color through the middle.
